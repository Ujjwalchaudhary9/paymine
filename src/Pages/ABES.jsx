                            <p >AEPS is an Aadhaar-enabled payment system that allows you
                                to perform a range of financial transactions with ease. These include making payments, interbank
                                or intrabank money transfers, withdrawals, deposits, checking your bank balance, and more. AEPS
                                is a simple, secure, and user-friendly platform that simplifies all your financial transactions.

                            </p>
                            <p>The AEPS works through MicroATM terminals that are
                                connected to the Aadhaar authentication server. When a customer initiates a transaction, the
                                business correspondent of any bank verifies the customer's identity using Aadhaar
                                authentication. Once the authentication is successful, the transaction is processed, and the
                                customer's account is debited or credited accordingly.
